    We are excited to announce the second edition of the Workshop on
    Correctness and Reproducibility for Climate and Weather Software,
    to be held on **November 5-7, 2025** at the Mesa Laboratory of the
    NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.
    We aim to provide a dedicated forum for climate and weather modelers, 
    software engineers, and the broader scientific software community to discuss
    challenges, opportunities, and recent advances in ensuring software correctness and reproducibility.


    This workshop is a follow-up to the [**inaugural workshop**](https://ncar.github.io/correctness-workshop-2023/) held in
    November 2023, which brought together participants from academia, research labs, and industry to
    share their experiences and insights on software correctness and reproducibility.
  

    This year's workshop will feature a **Tutorial on Rigor and Reasoning in Research Software**,
    sponsored by the [2025 Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship program](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/introducing-the-2025-bssw-fellows),
    which will include sessions on practical techniques for improving software quality
    and reliability in scientific computing. The tutorial will cover core topics such as
    unit testing, continuous integration (CI), property-based testing, correctness in AI,
    and reasoning in research software. The workshop will also include invited talks, panel discussions,
    and contributed presentations on a wide range of topics related to
    software correctness and reproducibility.


    **Call for Abstracts:**

    We invite contributions from researchers, software engineers, and practitioners
    in the climate and weather simulation community, as well as the broader scientific
    computing community. Topics include:

      - Testing, debugging, QA, and CI tools
      - Statistical and ensemble-based validation
      - Software design for correctness and reproducibility
      - Automated reasoning, formal methods, and verification techniques
      - Validation of HPC, cloud, heterogeneous, and GPU-based applications
      - Other verification and validation approaches

    Relevant applications include simulation codes, external libraries, AI techniques, diagnostics, packaging, and development practices.

      To be held in conjunction with the workshop, the **Tutorial on Rigor and Reasoning in Research Software** will focus on
      practical and novel techniques for improving software quality and reliability in scientific computing.
      The tutorial will cover core topics such as unit
      testing, continuous integration (CI), property-based testing, correctness in AI, and reasoning in research software,
      with practical examples drawn from climate modeling, data analysis, and similar applications. Participants will learn
      how to validate code, check software properties, and reason about high-level design in Python, with concepts broadly
      applicable to other scientific computing languages like Fortran and C++. 


      We will offer travel support to students and early-career researchers through an application process.
      More details will be provided soon.


      This tutorial is sponsored by the [2025 Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship program](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/introducing-the-2025-bssw-fellows).
